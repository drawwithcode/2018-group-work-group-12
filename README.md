This repository is the starting point of the assignments given in the elective course [Creative Coding at Politecnico di Milano](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=696598&__pj0=0&__pj1=3ed8420c42c849845b5caa3de626e8fc).

**Concept**

China's ancient and long-standing culture has many elements that have not yet been digitally interacted. We extracted Oracle as our design material based on cultural background.

At the same time, we use a Chinese ancient poem of the Tang Dynasty as a carrier of design material.This Chinese poetry tells people a story that the author tried to visit a hermit living in Mountain forest but when He got across hermit’s young disciple under the pine tree，the disciple is responed to the authour that his master has gone to mountains for collecting herbs.He only knew that his matser is just in this mountain he pointed out ,but he did not know the specific position where he is at due to thick cloud within the mountain.

This short poetry has rich and imaginative atmosphere and objects.The mountains,herbs,pine tree and clouds, as Symbol objects,present that Chinese ancient people not chase to fight for benefits from wealth and official position , but self-cultivation of minds and body, hermit life.

Through the traditional Chinese ink paintings as the background, we use the digital interactive way to present the conception of atmosphere and minds which author want to communicate to audiences.

Meanwhile, we selected 8 characters which are included in environment of atmosphere of this poetry as objects we want to anatomy their historical transform process from Oracle bone transcript, and introduce pictographic meaning of these characters to audiences.

**Design difficulties**

We chose an ancient poem of the Tang Dynasty as our homepage and painted the views in the poem, but it is very difficult to express the artistic conception of the ancient poetry. We selected 8 elements in the picture, such as cloud, rain, and found the corresponding Oracle. By clicking on these elements with the mouse, you can see the detailed meaning. We used Adobe Effect to make the evolution of these characters from Oracle to Bronze inscriptions or Seal Script to the Chinese characters we use today. Oracle is evolved from the early painting symbols, Bronze inscriptions or Seal Script is more regular, and the Chinese characters we use today are much simplified, so making this transformation is quite difficult.

**Code challenges:**

The main code chanllege is to connect the Chinese character(Oracle) with the sketch and interaction. First we combine the eight characters(bird, cloud, flower, house, human, mountain, rain, tree) in the homepage, and use hover function to make it could interact and click. In the bird page, we learn and use the three.js to create the sketch. In the cloud page, we use P5.js in Perlin noise to create the cloud. In the flower page, the difficult thing is to create the function in p5.js. In the house page, we create the 3D object and apply it into P5.js and make it could interact. In the human page, we use the TweenMax.js, which is for css animation. In the mountain page, we use very simple p5.js to create the Chinese style mountain sketch. In the rain page, we also use very simple p5.js to create the rain sketch. In the tree page, we learn, create and use the tree function in p5.js to create sketch.
